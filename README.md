# Bulk_Certificate_generater_and_emailer
We had an event where we had to mail e-certificates to every attendee when I was working as a co-convener in my
undergraduate society. It would have taken days if I had to transmit them one at a time. So I took inspiration from
various blogs and developed this code to accept a list of students along with some information and then email unique
certificates to all of the records in the database.
I'd appreciate it if someone took up this project and worked on the GUI.
